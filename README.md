## Summary of the Tech Stack
This sample page was built using HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I used JavaScript to implement the opening and closing of the navigation bar for mobile devices. Along with this I used [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) to host the website.
